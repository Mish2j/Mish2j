# Mishel Ghukasyan
## Frontend Software Engineer

I am pursuing a Computer Science degree at Cal Poly Pomona and am deeply passionate about creating web and mobile applications. My experiences include an internship at NASA GISS, volunteering at Resilience Inc., and contributing to open-source projects such as [ToolJet](github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet/pull/6573), [Nuclear](github.com/nukeop/nuclear/pull/1472). I prioritize simplicity in software development, particularly in user interfaces, and aim to make a positive impact through innovative, user-centered solutions.
